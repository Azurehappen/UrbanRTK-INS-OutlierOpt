UrbanRTK-INS-OutlierOpt is an open-source framework that integrates Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) 
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), 
utilizing a Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) Optimization approach. 
This repository is designed to provide robust outlier accommodation in urban environments,
where GNSS signals are often compromised due to obstacles like buildings and bridges.
