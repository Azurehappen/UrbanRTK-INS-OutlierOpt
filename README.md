# Risk-Averse Optimization-based Outlier Accommodation for RTK INS Fusion 

UrbanRTK-INS-OutlierOpt is an open-source framework that integrates Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) 
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), 
utilizing a diagonal-form of Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) Optimization approach.
The diagonal-form RAPS is an efficient (solved in polynomial time complexity) and elegant method, well-suited for real-time navigation.
This repository is designed to provide robust outlier accommodation in urban environments,
where GNSS signals are often compromised due to obstacles like buildings and bridges.

# Tutorials in this repo
1. IMU nonlinear time propagation using Quaternion. see `imu/insTimePropagation.m`.
2. Parser to Observation and Ephemeris RINEX files, see `parser/parserGnssObs.m` and `parser/parserGnssEph.m`. For more information refer to [RINEX 3.03](https://files.igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex303.pdf)
3. Implementation of Precise Point Positioning (PPP) corrections, such as the IGGtrop model (`corr/IGGtropSH_bl.m`, provided by IGGtrop paper author Dr. Wei Li, liwei@whigg.ac.cn) and SSR VTEC model (`corr/ssrVtecComputation.m`)

# Requirements
MATLAB (tested in version R2023a, certain toolboxes, such as [Optimization Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_topnav), may be required.)

Python (tested in Python 3.9. For generating KML file using `results/createTrajKml.py`)

# Running Setup
Uncompress `data\univOfTexas\univOfTexas.7z`.

The main file to run is titled `multiGnssMain.m`.

The default setting is to perform GNSS-RTK-Aided INS using RAPS for outlier recommendation.

To switch between RTK and DGNSS (code measurement-based): `p.post_mode  = p.mode_rtkfloat;` for RTK float; `p.post_mode  = p.mode_dgnss;` for DGNSS.

To change estimation mode: `p.est_mode = p.raps_ned_est;` for RAPS; `p.est_mode = p.map_est;` for Extended Kalman Filter (EKF);  `p.est_mode = p.td_est;` for Threshold Decision (TD).

The results for EKF-INS-RTK, TD-INS-RTK, and RAPS-INS-RTK were previously computed and saved in `results/`. To see the analysis of the results, run `results/figure_plot_dgnss.m`.

Google Earth 3D View uses a KML file generated by `results/createTrajKml.py` where it reads the experimental results from MATLAB `.mat` data file.

# Experimental Results
The open-source [TEX-CUP](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/texcup-desc/) dataset (2019May09) is used.  The experimental route traversing areas within the west campus of The University of Texas at Austin and downtown Austin, contains viaducts, high-rise buildings, and dense foliage. Results are estimated through forward (real-time) processing.

The RTK-GNSS/INS integration utilizes single-frequency measurements from a Septentrio receiver GPS L1, GLONASS L1, GALILEO E1, and Beidou B1.  The inertial measurements are provided by the LORD MicroStrain 3DM GX5-25 IMU with a sampling rate of 100 Hz.
